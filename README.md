ABSTRACT
This study investigates the impacts of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) with an emphasis on Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) on the operational efficiency of Brazilian aviation. The analysis is based on the number of takeoffs observed on the 14 busiest air routes in the country, which accounted for more than 1% of the total regular passenger air transport volume between 2010 and 2024. The research correlates the adoption of ITS with operational gains, such as reductions in flight time, fuel savings, and lower COâ‚‚ emissions into the atmosphere.
